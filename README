The Notifier works in the manner of an event dispatcher but handles uses strongly typed notifications instead of string event-types.
It is an merge between AS3-Signals and native ActionScript Events which combines the pro's with signals in a more ActionScript-native way.

The Main class is just an example class using the Notifier.
The three examples just shows the simplicity of use and three alternate ways of doing it.
